# Arduino-Alert-System

# 🔔 Arduino LCD + LED + Buzzer Alert System

This project demonstrates a multi-component Arduino setup using a **16x2 LCD display**, **LED indicators**, a **buzzer**, and a **potentiometer** for interactive display and alert functionalities. It is designed using [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/).

## ⚙️ Functionality

- The **LCD** displays system status messages.
- The **potentiometer** adjusts the LCD's contrast.
- **LEDs** act as condition indicators (e.g., warning, normal, safe).
- The **buzzer** activates for alerts or threshold violations (based on future code logic).
- The project may optionally include sensor input (e.g., IR/temperature) to trigger outputs.

## 📝 How to Use

1. Build the circuit as per the diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch (`buzzer_lcd_leds.ino`) to your Uno board.
3. Adjust the potentiometer until text is visible on the LCD.
4. Observe LED and buzzer behavior based on the programmed conditions.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Interfacing **LCD** with Arduino.
- Using **potentiometer** for contrast control.
- Programming **LEDs** and **buzzers** for status and alerts.
- Wiring and integrating **multiple outputs** in a single project.
